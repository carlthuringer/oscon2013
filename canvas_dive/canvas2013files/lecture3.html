<h3>GamePad API</h3>


<p>Since this is 2d scrolling platformer, we must consider
the fact that these sorts of games didn't originally use keyboards. They were designed for a kind of game controller known as a joypad or gamepad. 
This is what the original NES controller looked like.</p>

<p><img src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/NES-controller.jpg' width="500"></p>

<p>I picked up a modern USB equivalent at my local used electronics
store. While it has a few more buttons it's essentially the same.</p>

<p>Accesing the game pad is pretty easy with the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/'>new Game Pad API</a>.  This is a pretty new API and not supported everywhere, though it seems to keep getting better and better. Since iOS 7 has a new native game pad API we can hope that it will show up in iOS's Safari soon as well.  On the desktop you should use Chrome or FireFox. Hopefully Mac Safari and IE will be coming soon.</p>

<p>You can test out your browser at <a href='http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/gamepad/#disqus_thread' target='_blank'>this HTML 5 Rocks page</a></p>

<p>Determine if the browser supports gamepads like this:</p>

<pre><code>    var gamepadSupportAvailable = !!navigator.webkitGetGamepads || !!navigator.webkitGamepads;
    if(!gamepadSupportAvailable) return;</code></pre>

<p>Now we can get the list of gamepads.  This list will be full of empty entries until the user actually presses a button. This behavior is to prevent browser fingerprinting.  So always check that the pad object exists before trying to use it.</p>

<pre><code>var gamepads = navigator.webkitGetGamepads();

    var pad = gamepads[0];
    if(pad) {
        var xoff = pad.axes[0];
        var yoff = pad.axes[1];
        var punch = pad.buttons[0];
        var jump = pad.buttons[1];
        if(xoff &lt; -0.5) player.x -= 4;
        if(xoff &gt;  0.5) player.x += 4;
        if(jump == 1) dojump();
    }</code></pre>

<p>Now we can get the x and y from the axes array, and some buttons from the buttons array.  An axis will generally go from -1 to 1 and may or may not zero out right at 0. Instead of just checking for less than 0 check if greater or less than a certain threshold from zero. In this case I'm using 0.5.  Buttons will always be 0 or 1.</p>

<p>That's all there is to gamepad support. Here's the Ninja Cat game with gamepad support.</p>

<h4><a href='game_v15.html' target='_blank'>Game with GamePad support</a></h4>

<p>This API is still experimental and buggy, so be sure to file bugs if you find a particular joystick that doesn't work right.</p>


<h3>Multi-touch</h3>


<p>Many games will be played on touch only devices like an iPad. 
These devices have no keyboard or gamepad, just a touch screen. We could use regular mouse events, but that won't help if the player wants to press more than one button at a time, which is almost certainly the case in a game. Instead we'll move to multitouch events. Fortunately these are very well supported on virtually every mobile platform.</p>

<p>iOS pioneered touch events on the web and the W3C has standardized it. You will need to listen for the touchstart, touchmove, and touchend events. Teach event will contain three lists of touches: touches, targetTouches, and changedTouches. We are only interested in changedTouches since they contain the ones which trigger the events.</p>

<p>This is the code I used to detect left and right motion on the lower left of the screen and a tap motion on the lower right</p>
<pre><code>
var leftDown = false;
var rightDown = false;
var dirStartID = -1;
var jumpDown = false;
var jumpID = -1;
var dirStartX = 0;
var dirEndX = 0;
document.ontouchstart = function(e){ 
    e.preventDefault(); //disable default scrolling
    var touch = e.changedTouches[0]
    if(touch.clientX &lt; 500) {
        dirStartX = touch.clientX;
        dirStartID = touch.identifier;
    }
    if(touch.clientX &gt; 500) {
        jumpDown = true;
        jumpID = touch.identifier;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>First I declare some state variables. When a touch is started i check if it's on the left or right side of the screen. If it's on the left side then I'll use it as the D-pad. If it's on the right I'll use it as jump. For each case I save the touch identifier  so I can look it up later.</p>

<pre><code>document.ontouchmove = function(e) {
    if(e.changedTouches[0].identifier == dirStartID) {
        dirEndX = e.changedTouches[0].clientX;
        var diff = dirEndX-dirStartX;
        if(Math.abs(diff) &gt; 30) {
            if(diff &lt; 0) leftDown = true;
            if(diff &gt; 0) rightDown = true;
        } else {
            leftDown = false;
            rightDown = false;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>The touchMove event handler checks if the touch matches the id of the direction start. If it does then it calculates which way the user has dragged their finger, left or right. If they move far enough (more than 30 pixels) then it simulates the left or right keys being pressed using the leftDown and rightDown variables.</p>

<pre><code>document.ontouchend = function(e) {
    for(var i=0; i&lt;e.changedTouches.length; i++) {
        checkLeftRightTouch(e.changedTouches[i]);
        checkJumpTouch(e.changedTouches[i]);
    }
}

function checkLeftRightTouch(touch) {
    if(touch.identifier == dirStartID) {
        leftDown = false;
        rightDown = false;
        dirStartID = -1;
    }
}

function checkJumpTouch(touch) {
    if(touch.identifier == jumpID) {
        jumpDown = false;
        jumpID = -1;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Finally on touch end the code checks for matches with both ids and ends those actions</p>


<p>To make things simpler I modified my keyboard and gamepad input code to also use these leftDown, rightDown, and jumpDown variables. This makes it much easier to manage multiple forms of input.</p>

<p>Let's see what it looks like</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Performance is a huge topic, and it changes every day as devices and browsers get faster.  My general advice is to always draw less.  Use clipping so that you only draw things that are on screen.  If you have static backgrounds or foregrounds then move those into separate canvas elements so that the browser can composite them in hardware.  If you really are just drawing so many things on screen that it can't run in 60fps then consider switching from Canvas to WebGL. There are several toolkits that give you a 2D drawing API but use GL behind the scenes to speed it up. And of course you could go to real GL if you want.</p>

<p>A few other quick tips:

<ul>
<li>Cache static things into buffer images</li>
<li>Turn off pixel scaling. This probably won't help much on desktop, but on mobile you may see benefits.</li>
<li>use integer coordinates for images (vectors, not as much). Again this helps more on mobile than desktop.</li>
<li>Profile, profile, profile</li>

<p>Chrome has a really good profiler in it to let you see where the hotspots are in your app. This should always be the place you start when you have performance problems.</p>

<h3>App Packaging for Desktop</h3>

turn into a desktop mac app

<p>There are a variety of solutions for packaging up web content into a desktop app. <a href='https://github.com/appjs/appjs'>AppJS</a>, <a href='https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/'>Chromium Embedded</a>, <a href='http://cordova.apache.org/'>Apache Cordova</a>, <a href='https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit'>Node Webkit</a>, the <a href='http://www.sencha.com/products/desktop-packager/'>Sencha Desktop Packager</a> and <a href='http://bellite.io/'>Bellite</a>.</p>

<p>I recommend going with Apache Cordova because it is backed by Apache and is the core of PhoneGap, the professional product now owned by Adobe.  Cordova gives you a nice uniform API to code against, and is good about simply augmenting what the HTML standard provides.</p>

<p>For each target operating system you will still need the native build tools and have to set up a native project. Cordova provides templates and instructions for both desktop and mobile. They even have a command line api to make cross-platform projects easier to manage. However, for this demo I just want to show you Mac support. Since I don't actually need any of Cordova's extended APIs I'm going to show you a way to build a Mac app without using XCode at all. A wonderful little open source tool called: <a href='https://github.com/maccman/macgap'>MacGap.</a></p>


<pre><code>sudo gem install macgap
macgap new myapp
macgap build myapp</code></pre>

<p>This gives us a directory with an html file in it. The simplest possible thing. If I drop my code into it then I get an app like this. (run the app).</p>

<p>Unfortunately it doesn't support WebAudio so it's best for doing quick tests. If you want to ship a product, especially if you want to sell it in a real store like the Mac App store, then you should go with Apache Cordova.</p>


<h3>Building Mobile and iPad apps</h3>

<p>I won't cover how to turn this into a native iPad app. You can do that easily with Cordova and PhoneGap. That's what those tools were built for. The have great tutorials to help you get started and PhoneGap even has an online build service so you don't have to install any of the giant platform specific SDKs, like XCode.</p>

<p>I do want to show you another way of making local iPad apps, however. The user can save a page in the browser as a bookmark on the homescreen. Using a few extra settings you can make this feel very much like a native app has been installed, but that is still always updated through the web instead of the app store. Even if you choose to go PhoneGap long term, using a web app can be a real time saver when prototyping.</p>

<p>While doing this it's extremely helpful to use a remote debugger. Safari on Mac can debug iOS devices.  There are similar solutions for Windows Phone and Android devices. Cordova also has a tool called Winery.</p>

<p>First, add some hints at the top of the page to tell iOS that we want to treat this webpage special.</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;meta name = &quot;viewport&quot; content = &quot;user-scalable=no, width=device-width initial-scale=1.0'&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;apple-mobile-web-app-capable&quot; content=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;
&lt;style type='text/css'&gt;
html, body, canvas {
    border: 0; margin: 0; padding:0;
    background-color: black;
}
canvas {
    width: 100%;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The viewport meta tag tells the browser to disable scaling and set the width to the device width. The apple-mobile-web-app-capable note will disable the browser chrome like the URL bar and back button, leaving you with just the status bar. This is what really makes it feel like an app. Also, use some quick CSS to remove any excess space around the canvas and stretch it to 100% width.</p>

<p>I know this seems obvious, but give your app a title. The title you give will be used in the add to home screen dialog.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Ninja Cat&lt;/title&gt;</code></pre>

<pre><code>
document.ontouchstart = function(e){ 
    e.preventDefault(); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Apple has a great set of docs on the topic <a href='http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3'>here</a>.

<h3>Parting Shoughts</h3>

Canvas really is a great technology for building games, whether or not you decide to ship them in a webbrowser, as a desktop app, or as a mobile app. It's a great way to build cross platform apps quickly.  To whet your appetite I spent some time sprucing up my game to show you what it could look like with a bit more effort.
