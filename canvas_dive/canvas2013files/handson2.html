<h1>Hands On 2: Game Sound</h1>

<p>In this hands on we will use what we have learned about audio synthesis to add a sound track and sound effects to our game.</p>


<p>First we need to add some sound utility functions. Open your game and add this code that we learned from the last lecture.</p>

<p>The important thing in this hands on is that you should play. I've intentially given you less explicit instructions so you will have time to play with different sounds and make them your own.</p>


<pre><code>var sin = Math.sin;
var PI = Math.PI;
var floor = Math.floor;
var scale = {
    C4:261.626,
    D4:293.665,
    E4:329.628,
    F4:349.228,
    G4:391.995,
    A4:440.000,
    B4:493.883,    
}
var notes = [scale.E4, scale.D4, scale.E4, scale.F4];

var noteLen = 0.2;
function note(t) {
    var cur = (floor(t/noteLen) % notes.length);
    return notes[cur];
}
function tone(t,freq) { 
    return sin(t*2*PI*freq);
}
function lerp(t, lo, hi) { return (hi-lo)*t + lo; }

function adsr(t, a, d, s, r, al, sl) {
    if(t &lt; a) return lerp(t/a,0,al);
    t-=a;
    if(t &lt; d) return lerp(t/d,al,sl);
    t-=d;
    if(t &lt; s) return sl;
    t-=s;
    if(t &lt; r) return lerp(t/r,sl,0);
    return 0;
}
function envelope(t) {
    return adsr(t, 0.18, 0.15, 0.48, 0.19, 0.76, 0.08);
}
function music(t) {
    var ti = floor(t/noteLen)*noteLen;
    var t2 = (t-ti);
    var te = t2*noteLen;
    
    var freq = note(t);
    var ton = tone(t2, freq);
    var env = envelope(te);
    return ton*env;
}


var actx = new webkitAudioContext();
var jsnode = actx.createScriptProcessor(512,0,1);
var t = 0;
jsnode.onaudioprocess = function(e) {
    var output = e.outputBuffer.getChannelData(0);
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; output.length; i++) {
        output[i] = music(t);
        t += 1/44000.0;
    }
}
jsnode.connect(actx.destination);
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a basic fast repeating melody of four notes</p>

<h4><a href='game_v11.html' target='_blank'>Game with basic melody</a></h4>

<h3>Make your own music</h3>

<p>Now make your own melody by modifying the <code>notes</code> array. Start small with just a few notes then add more until you have a few bars. Change the tempo with the <code>noteLen</code> variable.  The current scale only has a single octave but you can add more frequencies from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies'>this list</a> on wikipedia.</p>

<p>Now try switching the tone generator function. Instead of a pure sin use the square or sawtooth functions.  The equations are:</p>

<pre><code>function square(t) {
    var v = sin(t);
    if(v &lt; 0) return -1;
    return 1;
}
function sawtooth(t) {
    t = t/(2*Math.PI);
    return (t - floor(t))*2 - 1;
}</code></pre>

<p>Now make up your own sound by mixing sin and square waves.  Here's a nice starting point. This mixes three waveforms at different frequencies.:
<pre><code>function tone(t,freq) { 
    var th = t*2*PI*freq;
    return (square(th*1.2) + sawtooth(th) + sawtooth(th*1.01))/3;
}</code></pre>

<p>Now change the ADSR settings. Use <a href='http://joshondesign.com/p/demos/sound/adsrviz/index.html' target='_blank'>the visualizer</a> to play around, then plug them into your code. The ADSR viz shows you values as percentages. You will need to use them as floating fractions, so 25% = 0.25.  Pay attention to the order of the arguments.  It goes A,D,S,R, then the attack level, then the sustain level.</p>


<h3>Sound Effects</h3>

<p>No game would be complete without some sound effects. Let's add a sound when the player jumps.  To keep it simple start with just a sine wave mixed into the main audio.  Create a <code>jumpsound</code> function which returns 0 when the player is on the ground and a sin wave when the player is in the air.</p>

<pre><code>function jumpsound(t) {
    if(player.getBottom() &gt;= ground) return 0;
    return sin(t*2*PI*200);
}</code></pre>

<p>To use this sound mix it with the main music track in the onaudioprocess callback.  Mixing audio waveforms is done by adding them together then dividing by the number of sounds; in other words the <i>average</i> of the diferent waveforms. This will mix the sounds evenly, meaning with the same volume.</p>

<pre><code>jsnode.onaudioprocess = function(e) {
    var output = e.outputBuffer.getChannelData(0);
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; output.length; i++) {
        <b>output[i] = (music(t)+jumpsound(t))/2;</b> //mix in the jump sound
        t += 1/44000.0;
    }
}</code></pre>

<h4><a href='game_v12.html' target='_blank'>Game with Jump Sound</a></h4>

<p>The sound is there but it's kinda boring. It would be nice if the sound conveyed the feeling of jumping by increasing the pitch.  This is pretty easy. We can multiply the frequency by t as it increases. There is a problem though. T starts at 0 when the game starts and increases forever. We want a t value that starts when the jump starts.  To fix this create a new t variable called <code>jumpt</code> which is set to 0 when the player is on the ground and only increases when the player is in the air.  Then use jumpt to modify the frequency as well as the t value for the sine wave. The new jumpsound function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>var jumpt = 0;
function jumpsound(t) {
    if(player.getBottom() &gt;= ground) {
        jumpt = 0;
        return 0;
    }
    jumpt += 1/44000.0;
    var freq = 260*(1+jumpt);
    return sin(jumpt*2*PI*freq);
}</code></pre>

<h3>Adding a Beat</h3>
<p>To make the audio complete let's add a second music track. This time it will just be a simple snare drum that repeats over and over.  We can simulate a snare drum with a short bit of noise. Start with a t value that repeats from 0 to one for every note, as we did with the music. Then return 0 if the value is less that 0.9, or a random number otherwise.  Choosing 0.9 means it will be silent for 90% of the note and only make noise for the last 10%, creating a simple snare drum effect.</p>

<pre><code>function drum(t) {
    var ti = floor(t/noteLen)*noteLen;
    var t2 = (t-ti)/noteLen;
    if(t2 &lt; 0.9) return 0;
    return Math.random();
}</code></pre>

<p>Since pure noise will seem much louder than tones I suggest you lower the drum's volume by dividing by 5. Play around with the numbers until you find something you like.</p>
<pre><code>        output[i] = (music(t)+jumpsound(t)+drum(t)/5)/3;</code></pre>

<p>That's it for sound. Please keep playing until it is time for the next lecture portion.  There is literally an endless variety of sounds you can create by just messing with simple math.</p>
