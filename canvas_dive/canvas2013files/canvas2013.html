	<h1>HTML Canvas Deep Dive</h1> <h2>2013 Edition: Games</h2>

	<p>Games account for about half of the apps in the typical app
store. They are among the first thing ported to any new platform.
Games help drive technology forward.  This year's edition of the
popular HTML Canvas Deep Dive will focus specifically on building
cross platform games for mobile and desktop. We will cover everything
needed to build basic games with animation, scrolling, sound effects
and music, image loading, sprites, and even joystick support. Then we
will learn how to package them to run on desktop and mobile devices,
both in and outside of app stores.</p>


<h3>Welcome</h3>

<p> Hi Welcome to HTML Canvas Deep Dive. This is the third year I've done the
talk and I think it will be our most exciting one yet. The problem with HTML is
that it keeps getting bigger. The technology grows to encompass more things.
First it was simple 2d, then 3d, now audio, camera input, and even joysticks.
And this is just the media related technologies. I haven't even touched on
networking and intensive processing. And they are all needed to get the most out
of Canvas. Fortunately, every year I record the new material in my free online
book at my website. This means you can still learn the things we don't have
enough time to cover here. So after this workshop please check it out. The
resources you will need for today's hands on workshop are available here.</p>

<h3>Why make games?</h3>

<p>	Since we can't cover everything, this year I decided to focus on
one area: games.  Games are a great way to learn the HTML Canvas
technologies because they touch on everything: graphics, sound,
performance tuning, and mobile support.  If you can do it with a
game, then chances are you can do it in something else.</p>


<h3>What is Canvas?</h3>


<p>	But before we dive into games, just what is HTML Canvas?</p>


<p>	Canvas is a part of HTML 5, or now just HTML. It's an HTML
    element which is essentially just a box in the page that you can draw
    into with JavaScript. You can draw lines, shapes, images, and text. 
    And in most cases it is now hardware accelerated, so drawing is very
    fast, at least on desktops.</p>


<p>	Since Canvas is a pretty well polished HTML standard it is now
supported by every major browser, even IE. In fact, IE 10 for desktop
has blisteringly good performance on Windows 7 and 8.  Canvas is also
supported in virtually every smart phone browser, though it's not as
fast as on desktop.</p>


<h3>2D vs 3D</h3>


<p>	Canvas is mainly for 2D bitmap graphics. However there is also a 3D
version of Canvas which goes by the name WebGL. As you might guess
from the name, it is essentially OpenGL running in your browser. This
makes it very fast but very tricky to program, as you are essentially
writing C and shader code in JavaScript. Most people don't code WebGL
by hand. They use a helper library like <a href='http://threejs.org/'>three.js</a>.  In the interest of
time we won't cover WebGL today, but there is a section of the online book
which walks you through creating a scene and loading up a 3d model.

<h3>Intro to Canvas</h3>


<p>	Before we start designing our game, lets look at a bit of canvas
code.</p>


<p><i>Follow these examples from chapter 1.</i></p>

<h3><a target='_blank' href='http://joshondesign.com/p/books/canvasdeepdive/chapter01.html#simple_drawing'>Simple Canvas Examples</a></h3>

<p>	The ebook has more in-depth examples showing how to build bar and
pie charts.</p>

<h3>Why make games in canvas?</h3>

<p>Now that we know what Canvas is, why should we make games using
it instead of some other technology like C++ or Java?  Probably the
most compelling reason is that it's a standard and it runs
everywhere.  Virtually every platform has some form of Canvas
support. While it's not as fast as native systems, there are some big
resources at Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other places that are
working very hard to make it faster and faster.  I also think Canvas
is great because you can code in JavaScript instead of C++. Again
while it's not as fast to run, it's usually fast enough and the
coding experience is so much better. I can whip up something in 30
minutes with Javascript that would take me hours in C++.</p>

<p>	It's also important to mention that Canvas is an open standard. 
Not only does it mean that different platforms support the same
features (roughly), because it is open you can implement it on new
platforms as they come along.  This gives Canvas a great future.</p>
